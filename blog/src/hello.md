## Work Experience

### **NLP Intern** @ **YAZI AI** 
*(Summer 2021)*

This project aimed to be a pioneer in Turkish NLP, as it was one of the first works on Turkish Financial Sentiment Analysis. I built scrapers for financial news websites and stock market movements. Then I tried to apply NER to the data I collected. The internship ended due to time constraints before I could complete the project.
I worked with Python.

I was completely inexperienced and mostly confused. I was very dependent on my supervisor and she was quite busy, so things did not really go as I wanted them to go.

### **Visiting Researcher Intern** @ **University of Kent** 
*(Summer 2022)*

At Kent, I was responsible with implementing a tool to collect data about DDoS protection adoption across the internet. I used Go, MongoDB and GCC. 
Since the tool was meant to scan the a huge number of domains weekly, it had to be performant. I benchmarked several approaches and libraries.

During the internship, I discovered my interest in programming languages and explored the academic life. I love learning new programming syntax, semantics and paradigms.

### **Mobile developer** @ **Upcarta**
*(March 2022 - Present)*

[Upcarta](https://www.upcarta.com/) is a platform for discovering, organizing and sharing content. Its killer feature is gathering scattered content recommendations, curations and collections from all around the web, streamlining the process of discovering content. I have a strong belief that what matters to humans will be humans they care about.

For the past year, I have been developing the mobile app of Upcarta. We use Flutter.

I learned Flutter all by myself and taught the rest of the team on the go. I had to make the architectural and stylistic decisions because flutter didn't/doesn't really have the idiomatic ways to guide us. It was quite a challenge.

Upcarta will be on the app stores soon. I can share a test link if you want to try Upcarta. Or you can just sign in from the web and use it.

## Today
Working on Upcarta, learning Rust. I am open to Rust developer positions.

This will also be a blog for me to organize and share my learning process/progress, food for thought and thought for food.
