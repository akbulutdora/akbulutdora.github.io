# Hello

My name is Dora, and I am a software developer from Turkey.

## Education
### Undergrad
I graduated with a BSc in **Computer Science** and Minor in **Philosophy** from **Sabanci University** in January 2023.

## Work Experience

### **NLP INTERN** @ **YAZI AI** (Summer 2021)
This project aimed to be a pioneer in Turkish NLP, as it was one of the first works on Turkish Financial Sentiment Analysis. I built scrapers for financial news websites and stock market movements. Then I tried to apply NER to the data I collected. The internship ended due to time constraints before I could complete the project.
I worked with Python.

I was very inexperienced and mostly confused. I was very dependent on my supervisor and she was quite busy, so things did not really go as I wanted them to go.

### **Visiting Researcher Intern** @ **The University of Kent** (Summer 2022)
At Kent, I was responsible with implementing a tool to collect data about DDoS protection adoption across the internet. I used Go, MongoDB and GCC. 
Since the tool was meant to scan the a huge number of domains weekly, it had to be performant. I benchmarked several approaches and libraries.

This internship made me discover my interest for programming languages. I love learning new programming syntax, semantics and paradigms.

### **Mobile developer** @ **upcarta**
[Upcarta](https://www.upcarta.com/) is a platform for discovering, organizing and sharing content. Its killer feature is gathering scattered content recommendations, curations and collections from all around the web.

For the past year, I have been developing the mobile app of upcarta. We use Flutter.

I learned Flutter all by myself and taught the rest of the team on the go. I had to make the architectural and stylistic decisions, and the Flutter framework didn't/doesn't really have many best practices and idiomatic ways to guide us. It was quite a challenge.

Upcarta Mobile will be on app stores soon. I can share a test link if you want to try upcarta.


## Today
Working on Upcarta, learning Rust. I am open to Rust developer positions.

This will also be a blog for me to organize and share my learning process/progress, food for thought and thought for food.
