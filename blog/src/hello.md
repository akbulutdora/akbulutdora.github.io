# Hello

My name is Dora, and I am a software developer from Turkey.

I recently graduated from Sabanci University, Istanbul.
I have two internship experiences:
- NLP INTERN @ **YAZI AI**: This work aimed to be a pioneer in Turkish NLP, as it was one of the first works on Turkish Financial Sentiment Analysis. I built scrapers for financial news websites and stock market movements. Then I tried to apply NER to the data I collected. The internship ended due to time constraints before I could complete the project.
- Visiting Researcher Intern @ **The University of Kent**:

For the past year, I have been developing the mobile app of [upcarta](https://www.upcarta.com/).

Now, I am learning Rust, and am open to Rust developer positions.

This will also be a blog for me to organize and share my learning process/progress, food for thought and thought for food.
